# Python-Scraper-companylist

** I downloaded a massive dataset of Finnish companies from the official site and made some quick adjustments to the Python script 🐞 in just ten minutes or so. After filtering the data, I ended up with a curated list of companies. **

** What was particularly interesting was verifying whether these companies had LinkedIn profiles. Running the script made it seem as if a robot 🤖  was controlling the mouse and operating the computer. **
